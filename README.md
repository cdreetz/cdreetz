## About

- 🌱 I love all things data and enjoy applying data based skills to solve problems and discover hidden insights. I especially like creating predictive models, forecasting time series data, and generating creative visuals that uncover patterns that may otherwise be overlooked.

- :mortar_board: My B.S. was in Statistics and Data Science, with a specialization in Finance and Actuarial Science, which I completed in 2022. Some of the topics I studied include applied regression analysis, multivariate analysis, time series analysis,  and also survival and hazard functions.

## Want to work?
 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on migrating all of my past projects onto Github and finding a position on a data driven team of individuals who both apply skills that create optimized results while still exploring new ideas and methods.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything! While I am looking to join a career position, I am open and eager to collaborate on almost any sort of work from personal projects to data competition teams to data consulting to even just giving advice on anything I am knowledgable on.

### Want to learn?

- 🤔 As a chronic learner I continue to be pulled to learning all sorts of new skills and topics.  Some things I am continuing to research on are best methods for building model ensembles, ML methods, and comparing various libraries within R so I am not just getting the work done, but doing it in the best possible ways.  While emphasising simplification and organization.

- :bulb: Just as much as I love learning, do I love teaching and helping.  During my learning process I am continually spending time collecting the best resources I come across and organizing them in ways that I hope others can benefit from.  I have an ever growing mind map of modeling methods that visualizes what they are, how they are related to one another, and cases in which they are best used or best not to be used.  Eventually I want to create a platform that acts as a guide for those learning and wanting to apply various modeling methods.
