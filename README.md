## About

âš¡ Statistics to Data Science to Machine Learning to Language Modeling

âš¡ Currently experimenting with new LM concepts: PEFT, LoRA, Distillation, Local Inference

ðŸŽ“ B.S. was in Statistics and Data Science, with a specialization in Finance and Actuarial Science, which I completed in 2022. Some of the topics I studied include applied regression analysis, multivariate analysis, time series analysis, and also survival and hazard functions.

ðŸŒ± I love all things data and enjoy applying data based skills to solve problems and discover hidden insights. I especially like creating predictive models, forecasting time series data, and generating creative visuals that uncover patterns that may otherwise be overlooked.


ðŸ”­ Some personal/for fun CV projects including pose estimation on embedded device, driving video pitch/yaw estimation, hand tracking
